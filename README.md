# Stats
A project I am working on using showing the stats of NHL players.  I am using it to learn new technologies that I have not worked with before.  

Includes all 31 current NHL teams.  Currently, I am  working on adding logos for each team.

Choosing a team will give a full roster showing the official photo, players name, number, and position they play.  
Soon, choosing a player will open a player card that will show the players details and season stats.
